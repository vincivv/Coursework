# migrations.py
#
# This file is responsible for managing database migrations. Migrations allow you to manage changes
# to the database schema over time, including creating tables, adding columns, and modifying the schema.
#
# Students are required to implement the following methods to perform migration tasks on the database.
#
# Example migration tasks include:
#   - Creating a new table.
#   - Adding new columns to an existing table.
#   - Removing columns from an existing table.
#   - Renaming columns in a table.
#   - Altering column types or constraints.
#
# Each method should:
#   - Open a connection and cursor to the database.
#   - Ensure the connection and cursor are properly closed after the operation, even in case of errors.
#   - Handle exceptions with appropriate error messages.
#   - Commit the transaction if the operation is successful, and rollback if there is an error.
