# Assignment 4 – Processing Fixed Length Record Data with Threads

Welcome to your fourth homework assignment.  

**NOTE:** The GitHub due date is the CUTOFF time and **not** the actual due date. See Canvas for the actual due date.

**Assignment Purpose and Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding Fixed Length Record Data files and how to parse them
- Understanding error handling
- Processing large quantities of data
- Summarizing data based on specific fields and criteria
- Understanding and using Vectors (arrays of pointers)
- Comprehensive use of threads and understanding the timings
- Understanding of Race Conditions and preventing data corruption 

**Let me remind you of the general expectations for all projects:** 
- All projects are done in C in the Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine.
- Code must be neat, with proper and consistent indentation and well documented. 
- Keep line to around 80 characters per line, and not line greater than 100 characters.
- Comments must describe the logic and reason for the code and not repeat the code.  
- Variables must have meaningful names and be in a consistent format (I do not care if you use camelCase or under_scores in variables but be consistent.
- You must use `make` to compile the program.
- You must use `make run` (sometimes with RUNOPTIONS) to execute the program.
- In addition, each file must have the standard header as defined below.
- All source files and writeup must be in the main branch of the github.
  
All primary filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>_HW<#>_<component>.<proper extension>`, except Makefile.

Each .c and .h file must have a standard header as defined below.  Make sure to put in your section number (replace the #), your name, your student ID, a proper project name, GitHub name, filename, and description of the project.  Do not alter the number of asterisks and ensure that the header starts on line 1 of the file.

```
This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.  You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

This assignment is in three specific parts:

1) Being able to open and correctly parse a Header and Data file
2) Being able to process data in order to summarize and visualize data
3) Being able to do these tasks in multiple threads

For this assignment, all file operations must be done using only the **Linux** file functions **open**, **read**, **pread**, **lseek**, **close**, **stat**, or **fstat**.  No other file operations are allowed and not all those listed need to be used.

**For part 1 - Fixed Length Record Data File Processing**

A Fixed Length Record Data file is a binary file where columnar (field) data is stored in fixed width fields.  The sum of the widths of each field make up the length of the total record.  All records are the same length, and each field within the record as a fixed position and width.
To determine the record length and to handle columns you will have to read the header file (called "header.txt") that contains the width of the field and the name of the field.  A portion of the file looks like this:

```
10: cad_number
10: dup_cad_number
15: pd_incident_report
25: received_datetime
...
35: analysis_neighborhood
15: police_district
...
```
The sum of all the field lengths is the size of each record in the database.  You can use the function **atoi** to convert ascii strings to integer numbers.  Think about what information you actually need for each field you need.

The location in the file of any record (n) is simply (n-1) * recordlength.  This makes it easy to assign different sets of records to different threads (more on this in part 3).  It also means that the number of records in the file is simply the total file size / recordlength.

The data file is composed of multiple records each records with the fields specified in the header file.  The contents of each field is an ASCII string (null terminated).  Specifically, datetime fields such as **received_datetime** are stored in an ascii format of MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM, example: "02/26/2025 10:09:15 PM".  Since you will be subtracting two different datetime fields you will want to convert it into something you can manipulate.  This could be a total number of seconds from a base time, it can be a structure containing integers for each of the fields (i.e. year, month, day, hour, minute, second) or any other way you want to manipulate the values so you can do the subtraction of one datetime from another.



**For part 2 - Data Processing**

For this part you will build a data structure (of your choice) that keeps tract of every event type (specifically the field `call_type_final_desc`, unless that field is blank then use the `call_type_original_desc` field).  You will keep with each event type the total number of calls, the values of the dispatch_datetime - received_datetime, the onscene_datetime - enroute_datetime, and the onscene_datetime - received_datetime  You will also selectively keep track of those times for either 2 neighborhoods or police districts.  Specifically, 2 values from the `analysis_neighborhood` field or the `police_district` field depending on the command line parameters.  You will also calculate a Total section of the entire city regardless of the neighborhood or police district.  You will also have a total for the entire city and each of the neighborhoods/districts regardless of call type.
From the data in your data structure, you will need to calculate statistics which include:

- Maintain the minimum and maximum values
- Calculate the Median (the middle number of the number set)
- Calculate the Q1 and Q3 values (which are the middle number of the lower half and the middle number of the upper half)
- Calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) (Q3 - Q1)
- Calculate the Lower bound (the greater of the minimum value or Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)
- Calculate the Upper bound (the lesser of the maximum value or Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)
- Calculate the mean and the standard deviation
- Values below the lower bound are considered outliers as are those above the upper bound


The output should be well formatted and columnar with clear headings.   This is a short example (having all time differences in seconds) of what the output can look like:

So, there should be 9 "pages" of data output
- Total   -  Dispatch Time - Received Time
- Total   -  OnScene Time - Enroute Time
- Total   -  OnScene Time - Received Time
- Neighborhood/District-1   -  Dispatch Time - Received Time
- Neighborhood/District-1   -  OnScene Time - Enroute Time
- Neighborhood/District-1   -  OnScene Time - Received Time
- Neighborhood/District-2   -  Dispatch Time - Received Time
- Neighborhood/District-2   -  OnScene Time - Enroute Time
- Neighborhood/District-2   -  OnScene Time - Received Time

You my use any data structure you like to hold the data as it is being processed, but it must be global (i.e. each thread will be adding directly to it and not merging at the end) and you have to write the data structure code yourself, not using libraries. (Note: using string libraries for copying and comparing are okay). In addition, since standard deviation requires taking the square root of the sum of the squares you can #include <math.h> and use the `sqrt ()` function.

**For part 3 - Threading**
The catch, it is to do all this using threads. Each thread will manage a proportional number of the records of the file and process it, returning it’s results tallied to shared memory and then the main will print the results as specified above. Remember that this assignment will be using the pthread functions.  
If you are running with the Law500K.dat file, and you specify 2 threads, each thread will process 250,000 records, if 4 threads then each will process 125,000 records.  Since read is an expensive operation, you could have each thread read in a "group" of records at a time (say 2000 at a time, to reduce the number of calls to read).

We want to determine how long the program takes using different number of threads (separate runs).  

To Do So:
#include <time.h> in your code and in main, include the code below in your main.  This will display how much time your program takes.  Your submission must include a run with 1 thread, 2 threads, 4 threads, and 8 threads.  How do the times compare?

```
    //**************************************************************
    // DO NOT CHANGE THIS BLOCK
    //Time stamp start
    struct timespec startTime;
    struct timespec endTime;

    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &startTime);
    //**************************************************************

    // *** TO DO ***  start your thread processing
    //                wait for the threads to finish


    // ***TO DO *** Display Data

    //**************************************************************
    // DO NOT CHANGE THIS BLOCK
    //Clock output
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &endTime);
    time_t sec = endTime.tv_sec - startTime.tv_sec;
    long n_sec = endTime.tv_nsec - startTime.tv_nsec;
    if (endTime.tv_nsec < startTime.tv_nsec)
        {
        --sec;
        n_sec = n_sec + 1000000000L;
        }

    printf("Total Time was %ld.%09ld seconds for %s threads.\n", sec, n_sec, argv[3]);
    //**************************************************************

```
There is a template main with this code provided. (Don't forget to rename it to the naming conventions).  Do not modify in any way the blocks that start and end the timers (including the asterisks).  Make sure that other than initialization code and cleanup code that your code is between these blocks where the `TO DO`'s are.


**Command Line Parameters**
```
<program> <data filename> <header filename> <threads> <subfield> <subfield value 1> <subfield value 2>
make run RUNOPTIONS="Law500K.dat header.txt 4 police_district BAYVIEW MISSION"
make run RUNOPTIONS="Law500K.dat header.txt 2 analysis_neighborhood 'Russian Hill' 'Outer Richmond'"
```

data filename:  is the name of the data set. One of the following (each of these are links to the file):
- [Law5K.dat](https://sfsu.box.com/s/y8k4cpmi5kw40329uft3jp7bywwd57qb)
- [Law10K.dat](https://sfsu.box.com/s/l9k8sxomxmx410scamfvq7tmoxwqjiq3)

- [Law_Full.dat](https://sfsu.box.com/s/9547tfcl6qadznmwbhpeqh4ky1mrnkh0)

threads:  is how many threads you will dispatch to process the data.  Remember that you have to submit common runs with 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads, using the Law500K.dat file.  Common runs means with the same sub-field and sub-field values between each thread run.

subfield: is either `analysis_neighborhood`  or  `police_district`

The subfield value's (1 and 2) is one of the field values from `analysis_neighborhood`  or  `police_district`

**Hints** Do not forget to protect critical sections. Make sure you use thread safe library calls. Do not use pipes. You must use mutex locks.

Do a writeup using the template in PDF format that includes your approach in detail, issues, resolutions and an **analysis** of the results. The **analysis** is in two parts.  First part is to analyze the output and explain if the results of the statistics you generated were what you expect and explain them in a brief paragraph (i.e. what do the statistics tell us about police response time).  Part two of the analysis is to Explain and reflect on why the times for the different runs are what they are, how does each run compare with the others. Also include the compilation and execution output from your program in the writeup. Your execution output must include at least 4 common runs of, 1 thread, 2 threads, 4 threads, and 8 threads, using the Law500K.dat file. Common runs means with the same sub-field and sub-field values between each thread run.  Submit all your source code file(s), Makefile and PDF writeup into GitHub. The writeup (PDF) should also be submitted to Canvas.

**Note** Do not change any of the settings of the virtual machine.
